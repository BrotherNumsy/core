<h1 id="label-Welcome+to+OpenCrowbar">Welcome to OpenCrowbar</h1>

<p>Welcome to the OpenCrowbar Project - the gateway to a new hardware
provisioning experience that delivers the best of software deployment
automation and orchestration. OpenCrowbar is a successor of the 3 year-old
&amp; still active <a href="http://github.com/crowbar">Crowbar project</a>.
It derives much of its functionality from its predecessor, but offers a lot
more.</p>

<h2 id="label-Getting+Started+%26+Documentation">Getting Started &amp; Documentation</h2>

<p>Documentation close by and located in under the <strong>/doc</strong>
directory of OpenCrowbar and for each workload module.</p>

<p>Please refer to the <a href="/doc/README.md">/doc directories</a> for
detailed information. We attempt to define and maintain one sub-directory
for each functional element. This structure is intended to be common across
all workloads in the <a href="https://github.com/opencrowbar/">OpenCrowbar
project</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Please, do NOT add documentation in locations outside of the
<strong>/doc</strong> directory trees! If necessary, expand this README to
include pointers to important <strong>/doc</strong> information.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We&#39;ve also made it easy to setup and run Crowbar using our <a
href="/doc/development-guides/dev-systems">Fast-Start (with Docker)</a> as
a rapid-fire code/test/commit cycle tool.</p>

<h2 id="label-Exec+Summary">Exec Summary</h2>

<p>The principal motivation for creation of OpenCrowbar is the transition a
from bare metal installer into a tool that manages ongoing operations.
OpenCrowbar enables upgrade and continuous deployment automation. This
capability is important for large scale deployments of evolving complex
projects like OpenStack, Hadoop, and Ceph.</p>

<p>OpenCrowbar provides the foundation for operations automation. OpenCrowabr
is an open reference implementation that can be reliably deployed in
large-scale, multi-site datacenters. This effectively productizes best
practices in a way that allows cration of consistent and discoverable
operating environments. Users benefit with fast time-to-value and we
benefit by having consistent installations across the ecosystem.</p>

<h2 id="label-Benefits+of+OpenCrowbar">Benefits of OpenCrowbar</h2>

<p>OpenCrowbar reduces the cost of datacenter hardware infrastructure
preparation. The immediate benefits of OpenCrowbar are realized in the
deployment of complex compute and storage clusters. OpenCrowbar reduces the
human resource cost of getting compute platform systems into productive
use, automates continuous hardware redeployment, automates hypervisor,
operating systems, and application layer software installation and
management. All of these add up to significant gains in operational
reliability, consistency, and concomitant reduction in defects handling
costs.</p>
