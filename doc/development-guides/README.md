# OpenCrowbar Developers' Guide

Welcome to the amazing fuzziness of OpenCrowbar!  

This guide is targeted at people who want to _contribute and extend_ OpenCrowbar.  You should review the architectural and operator instructions as part of the learning process.

## Dev Environment

Our development environments include a _working_ administrative server for testing.  It is very important in our process that developers are able to run deployments in their environment as part of the testing cycle.  

While we have invested in BDD and system tests to catch core logic errors, most changes require performing a deployment to test correctness!

The following steps are focused on: 

1. [Ubuntu 12.04.03](./development/dev-ubuntu-12.04.03.md)
1. [Ubuntu VM - General](./development/dev-vm-Ubuntu.md)
1. [Fedora Core 19](./development/dev-vm-Fedora.md)
1. [SUSE](./development/dev-vm-SUSE.md)
1. [OpenSUSE Images](./development/openSUSE-images.md)
