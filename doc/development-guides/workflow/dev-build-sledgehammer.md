Sledgehammer is the component of OpenCrowbar that we use as a bootstrapping 
tool to perform initial node discovery and to register its discovered
state within the OpenCrowbar node provisioning framework. After it has been
discovered Sledehammer can be controlled to prepare the hardward and to 
lay down the operating system and to assure correct node configuration.
It consists of a slightly modified Centos 6.5 live environment.  To build
Sledgehammer you need:

  * A CentOS 6.5 install DVD from bittorrent or your favorite CentOS
    mirror. 

update Sledgehammer, run the **PUT INFO HERE** script in the main
OpenCrowbar core checkout.
