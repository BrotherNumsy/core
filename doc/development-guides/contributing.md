##Contributing Code

###Fork The Code

> we assume you already have a clone of  `https://github.com/opencrowbar/core`

  1. create a personal fork of the `https://github.com/opencrowbar/core`
    1. Fork the code if you want to be able to submit changes
    1. You may want to rename your fork in Github to something like 'crowbar-core' to make it easier to track.  We'll assume that you did that in these directions
  1. setup your git identity (one time only)
    1. `git config --global user.name "user.name"`
    1. `git config --global user.email "email.address"`
  1. add a personal remote: `git remote add personal `https://github.com/[yourgitnamehere]/[crowbar-core]`
  1. you can check your remotes using `git remote -v`

##To create a pull request

  1. make your change and commit it: `git commit -a -m "I cut and pasted this"`
  1. get the latest code from origin: `git fetch`
  1. sync your code into the trunk: `git rebase`
     1. you may have to merge changes using `git add [file]= and =git rebase --continue--`
  1. run and pass all the BDD tests, [[link missing]]
  1. push your change to your personal repo in a branch: `git push personal master:[my-pull-request-branch]`
  1. from your Github fork UI, create a pull request from my-pull-request-branch

##Edit Documentation

You do NOT need a local clone to update docs!  You can edit them right from your fork on Github.  Just make the changes and then create a pull request.  

We love DOCS changes.
